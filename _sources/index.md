# Partial Differential Equations

## Outline

MATH 316 is an introduction to partial differential equations including:

* analytical methods for ordinary differential equations
* power series solutions of linear equations
* Fourier series solutions of the heat, Laplace and wave equations
* finite difference methods for the heat, Laplace and wave equations
* boundary value problems and Sturm-Louiville theory
