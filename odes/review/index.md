# Review of Methods to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations

In this section, we briefly review some techniques to solve ordinary differential equations in special cases such as:

* separation of variables to solve first order separable equations
* integrating factor to solve first order linear equations
* roots of the characteristic polynomial to solve second order equations with constant coefficients
* substitutions to solve Cauchy-Euler equations
